# Sending commits to a remote

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress" collapsible=true
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://jj-for-everyone.github.io/reset.sh | bash -s remote
cd ~/jj-tutorial/repo
```
````

Your commits are stored locally, which means they are not backed up. To back up your work and collaborate with others, you can send your commits to a **remote**.

While services like [GitHub](https://github.com/) are common, this tutorial uses a simple local directory as a remote for learning purposes. This method is not suitable for real-world backups or collaboration but is perfect for understanding the mechanics.

## Initialize the Remote

First, create a "bare" Git repository to serve as the remote. A bare repository contains only version history, with no working copy of the files.

```sh
git init --bare -b main ~/jj-tutorial/remote
```

````admonish note title="The difference between remote (bare) and regular repositories" collapsible=true
A regular Jujutsu repository has two parts: (1) the internal database (`.git` and `.jj` directories) and (2) the **working copy** of your files that you can edit.

A "bare" repository is a Git repository **without a working copy**. Since we only use the remote for sending and receiving commits, a working copy isn't needed. The `-b main` flag sets the default branch name to "main".
````

## Connect to the Remote

Next, connect your local repository to the remote. By convention, the primary remote is named **origin**.

```sh
jj git remote add origin ~/jj-tutorial/remote
```

For a service like GitHub, you would use a URL instead of a local path. Verify the remote was added:

```sh
jj git remote list
```

## Add a Bookmark

To push a commit, you must first attach a **bookmark** to it. Bookmarks are named labels that mark important commits to be kept on the remote.

Let's create a bookmark called **main**, a common convention for the project's primary state, and point it to your commit.

```sh
jj bookmark create main --revision mkmqlnox # <- substitute your change ID here
```

The command `jj bookmark create` expects a name (`main`) and a commit to which the bookmark should point.
We identify the commit by its change ID (`--revision mkmqlnox`).
The flag `--revision` can also be abbreviated as `-r`.
Let's check the result with `jj log`:

</pre>

The output shows the `main` bookmark pointing to your commit.

## Push the Bookmark

With the remote connected and the bookmark in place, you can now "push" your commit.

```sh
jj git push --bookmark main --allow-new
```

The `--allow-new` (or `-N`) flag is required the first time you push a new bookmark. This safety measure prevents accidentally pushing local-only bookmarks.

You can disable this requirement if you prefer:
```sh
jj config set --user git.push-new-bookmarks true
```
