## Resetting Your Progress

This tutorial builds an example repository. Chapters build on previous ones. If you get stuck or want to start a chapter fresh, you can use a reset script.

Each chapter provides the exact command to reset to its beginning. For example:

````admonish reset title="Reset your progress"
To reset your progress to the start of this chapter, run the following command:

```sh
curl https://jj-for-everyone.github.io/reset.sh | bash -s install
```
````

If you prefer not to run a script directly from the internet, you can [download it](./reset.sh), inspect it, and run it locally.
