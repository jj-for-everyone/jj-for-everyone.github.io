# Must-know secret commands

Hah, did I get you with the clickbait title? :-P

Sorry, that's all I have for you at the moment.
Remember, there's an [overview of planned levels](watch_releases.md) in the introduction.
If any of the future content sounds interesting to you, consider [subscribing to releases](watch_releases.md) on GitHub.
That way I can notify you without knowing your email.
I will also notify subscribers if a new release of Jujutsu changes something that's relevant to the content of this tutorial.

I hope you learned some valuable skills in this tutorial.
I always appreciate hearing your feedback, suggestions, experience reports and frustrated rants!
Just [post an issue](https://github.com/jj-for-everyone/jj-for-everyone.github.io/issues/new) on GitHub.
Thanks! ❤️
